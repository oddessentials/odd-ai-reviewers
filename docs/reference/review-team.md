      <h3>Why odd-ai-reviewers?</h3>
      <em>The Power of the Team</em>
      <p>Each tool in our review team excels at something different: Ollama provides local AI inference, OpenCode assists with intelligent coding, PR Agent automates PR reviews, Review Dog bridges linters to PRs, and Semgrep catches security vulnerabilities. Individually, they're powerful. Together, they're unstoppable.</p>
      <p>odd-ai-reviewers integrates all five tools into a unified code review pipeline. Instead of configuring each tool separately, you get a pre-configured, battle-tested setup that combines their strengths. The result? Comprehensive code reviews that catch bugs, enforce standards, identify security issues, and provide AI-powered insights - all in one cohesive workflow.</p>
