# ============================================================================
# OpenCode CLI Binary (Go runtime CVEs)
# 
# OpenCode v1.1.26 is compiled with an older Go runtime that contains these
# vulnerabilities. We are using the latest available release. The OpenCode
# team must release a new version compiled with Go 1.24.11+ or 1.25.5+ to fix.
#
# Risk assessment: LOW - OpenCode runs in isolated subprocess with stripped
# tokens and socket listener guards (CVE-2026-22812 mitigation in place).
# ============================================================================
